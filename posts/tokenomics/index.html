<p>Tokenization has always existed, directly or indirectly, but Crypto puts it on steroids with this sector's permissionless values.</p>
<p>Creating a token on any chain might be easy, but making a great token on any chain requires a great product and then a tightly coupled tokenomics design for the product’s flywheel.</p>
<h2 id="the-fundamentals-of-tokenomics-design">The Fundamentals of Tokenomics Design</h2>
<p>You’ll need to understand how to knit fundamentals from demand drivers to network effects and speculative value.</p>
<h3 id="demand-drivers">Demand Drivers</h3>
<p>Demand drivers are the core mechanisms/reasons for users to acquire tokens. Usually, the demand driver would be the product’s growth and futuristic value that aligns with the user’s interest.</p>
<p>The demand driver of a dApp Aerodome is that the platform accrues trading fees that will be distributed to token holders. The demand drivers for L1 projects like Ethereum are gas fees and governance.</p>
<h3 id="network-effects">Network Effects</h3>
<p>As the dApp grows, demand for tokens is likely to increase, especially if the dApp offers a token-based subscription service.</p>
<p>More stakers means more liquidity, especially on proof of liquidity chains; higher liquidity improves yields and strengthens the ecosystem.</p>
<p>On Ethereum, primarily through liquid staking, there’s more liquidity and stakers are incentivised to stay for the juicy yield.</p>
<h3 id="speculative-value">Speculative Value</h3>
<p>Speculations aren’t sustainable in the long term. They’re usually high initially and must ride narratives to be sustained. You’ll see this in NFTs and memes; they’re a big deal.</p>
<p>Speculative value is excellent, but you must build a great product that gains adoption to sustain the hype.</p>
<h3 id="value-capture"><strong>Value Capture</strong></h3>
<p>Value capture aligns the incentives of all participants (users, investors, and the protocol) to create a sustainable economic model that ensures everyone stays and plays their part correctly.</p>
<p>Protocols use mechanisms like burning, fee redistribution, and lockup smart contracts to capture value, depending on the participants they’re trying to capture value.</p>
<h3 id="business-model-integration">Business Model Integration</h3>
<p>Unless you’re building a memecoin, you’ll want to interweave the tokenomics with the project’s business model tightly.</p>
<p>For business model integration, Most DEX projects that generate revenue via trading fees distribute a portion of those to token holders and have proposals to fund their projects.</p>
<h3 id="game-theory-in-tokenomics"><strong>Game Theory in Tokenomics</strong></h3>
<p>You’ll need to implement some game theory to keep participants in check, incentivise normal behaviour and deter occurrences that may harm the product.</p>
<p>You must analyze the participants' behaviours and scenarios and offer incentives or punishments to keep them from misbehaving.</p>
<p>Mechanisms like bonding curves or quadratic voting can balance resource allocation and prevent a few players from dominating.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-supply-mechanics">Understanding Supply Mechanics</h2>
<p>Supply mechanics are the cartilage of tokenized systems. Your supply mechanisms dictate how your tokens are created, allocated and introduced over time.</p>
<p>Your supply mechanics configurations (<strong>supply distribution</strong> and <strong>inflation)</strong> influence everything from user participation to long-term value accrual.</p>
<h3 id="supply-distribution">Supply Distribution</h3>
<p><strong>Token allocation</strong> is the most basic form of supply distribution. It determines incentive alignment across stakeholders and the community.</p>
<p>Poorly designed token allocations can introduce centralization among sects of stakeholders, induce rapid price crashes, and quickly disengage the community.</p>
<p>Here’s an intuitive table that overviews a chic supply distribution model:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><strong>Stakeholder</strong></th><th><strong>Purpose/Role</strong></th><th><strong>Typical Share</strong></th><th><strong>Mechanisms</strong></th><th><strong>Best Practices</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><strong>Founders &amp; Team</strong></td><td>Drive project vision and execution, ensuring long-term success.</td><td>10-20%</td><td>- <strong>Linear Vesting:</strong> Tokens released over 4+ years. <br>- <strong>Cliffs:</strong> 1-year lock-up before vesting begins.</td><td>Avoid excessive allocation to build trust and reduce centralization concerns.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Early Investors</strong></td><td>Provide early-stage capital and take on higher financial risk.</td><td>10-15%</td><td>- Discounted tokens (20-50% off). <br>- Lock-up periods: 6-24 months with gradual unlocking to prevent pump-and-dump.</td><td>Ensure transparency in lock-up terms and align incentives with long-term project goals.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Community Incentives</strong></td><td>Foster user engagement and decentralization through staking, airdrops, and rewards.</td><td>Up to 50% or more</td><td>- Airdrops for early adopters. <br>- Learn-to-Earn and Participate-to-Earn programs to incentivize engagement.</td><td>Prioritize mechanisms that ensure wide distribution and encourage active participation in the ecosystem.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>This table isn’t a one-size-fits-all. You’ll need to approach considerations based on what you’re building.</p>
<h3 id="supply-inflation">Supply Inflation</h3>
<p>Inflation mechanisms determine a token’s circulating supply. They influence factors like token scarcity, ecosystem incentives, and the currency's long-term value.</p>
<p>With suitable inflation mechanisms, you’ll need to strike the right balance between incentives and value. Here are some great inflation models.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><strong>Model</strong></th><th><strong>Description</strong></th><th><strong>Advantages</strong></th><th><strong>Challenges/Risks</strong></th><th><strong>Use Cases</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><strong>Fixed Supply</strong></td><td>Total token supply is capped (e.g., Bitcoin's 21 million tokens).</td><td>- Creates scarcity, driving long-term demand. <br>- Predictable supply maintains value stability.</td><td>- Deflationary pressures from lost tokens. <br>- May discourage spending over time.</td><td>Scarcity-focused projects or digital gold analogs like Bitcoin.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Controlled Inflation</strong></td><td>A steady issuance of new tokens rewards participants and validators (e.g., Ethereum).</td><td>- Incentivizes active network participation. <br>- Mitigates deflation by replacing lost tokens.</td><td>Oversupply risks if issuance exceeds demand.</td><td>Projects emphasizing sustained incentives and network security.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Exponential Inflation</strong></td><td>High early token issuance to bootstrap network activity.</td><td>- Encourages rapid adoption in the early stages.</td><td>- Risk of oversaturation if not tapered effectively.</td><td>Early-stage DeFi projects seeking quick user acquisition.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Linear Inflation</strong></td><td>Tokens issued at a constant rate over time.</td><td>- Ensures predictable, steady growth. <br>- Minimizes risks of economic shocks due to abrupt changes.</td><td>Less flexible to dynamic market conditions.</td><td>Mature ecosystems aiming for long-term stability.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Your business model integration and use case should help you decide on the supply inflation mechanism you choose</p>
<p>Consider these principles part of your mechanisms to adapt effectively to changing conditions.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><strong>Principle</strong></th><th><strong>Description</strong></th><th><strong>Objective</strong></th><th><strong>Example/Best Practice</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><strong>Vesting and Lock-Ups</strong></td><td>Vesting schedules ensure gradual token release for founders and investors.</td><td>Prevent market manipulation and align incentives with long-term project success.</td><td>4-year vesting with a 1-year cliff for team tokens to foster commitment.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Dynamic Adjustments</strong></td><td>Community governance mechanisms to modify inflation rates or supply dynamics as needed.</td><td>Ensure adaptability to changing market conditions and network needs.</td><td>Allow token holders to vote on inflation rate changes via decentralized governance proposals.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Incentive Alignment</strong></td><td>Allocate sufficient tokens for ecosystem participation without excessive centralization.</td><td>Foster decentralized engagement and prevent network stagnation or over-concentration of power.</td><td>Reserve 50%+ of supply for community rewards like staking, liquidity mining, or airdrops.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Burn Mechanisms</strong></td><td>Reduce supply by burning tokens, often sourced from transaction fees or penalties.</td><td>Counter inflation and maintain token value stability.</td><td>Ethereum’s EIP-1559 burns a portion of transaction fees to create a deflationary effect.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>These principles help balance out some of the challenges with supply inflation mechanisms.</p>
<h2 id="token-lifecycle-management">Token LifeCycle Management</h2>
<p>Throughout your token's lifecycle, you and your stakeholders must manage multiple aspects based on the project's milestones and supply dynamics.</p>
<p>In the early stages, you’ll set the initial token supply and issuance rates to balance short-term growth objectives with long-term sustainability goals. Your cliff schedules should align early backers with the project’s roadmap without creating centralization through any means.</p>
<p>You’ll also have to make some adjustments post-TGE (token generation event), like campaigns to retain users or buyback tokens to stabilize market value and reduce volatility.</p>
<p>Once you’ve found a stance in the market, you can control market dynamics as you deem fit, from high inflation to low-emission or deflationary models to preserve token value as the ecosystem matures.</p>
<h2 id="your-project-probably-doesn-t-need-a-token">Your Project Probably Doesn’t Need a Token</h2>
<p>Pay attention to the intensity of demand drivers and your business integration; from a user experience standpoint, does your project need a token? Remember that launching a token incorrectly or treating it as a separate product could cascade on the product.</p>
<p>You can always try out alternatives, like using the token of the underlying chain you’re building on and using external governance providers instead.</p>
