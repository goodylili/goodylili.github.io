crisis, internal strife, self-destruction, whatever you choose to call it, the upshot is that the decentralized web (Web 3.0) is poised to take on mature responsibilities in its infancy.\nWeb 3.0 and public distributed ledger technologies wrestle against multiple trillion-dollar companies and unicorns with barely two trillion dollars in market capitalization; Do we call the cops? Is the chase for decentralization in circles like a maze with no outlets?\nHold up! Wait for a second! What did we expect? the internet (web 2.0) was once a bubble, had its crisis, and had to set up protocols for interoperability and synchronization.\nMaybe the best way to build is to experiment, trial and error, rinse and repeat. In the case of the decentralized web, there is a lot to fix, standards to set up, and chaos to settle.\nIn this publication, I overview the web3.0 chaos and significant transformations that could lead to building a truly decentralized internet.\nNote: Blockchains are used throughout this publication to refer to distributed ledger technologies generally.\nInteroperability: The Architectural Chaos\n\n\nThe future will be multi-chain, but it will not be cross-chain: there are fundamental limits to the security of bridges that hop across multiple \"zones of sovereignty\" - Vitalik Buterin.\n\nBlockchain interoperability is the ability of different blockchains to interact and share value and information.\nImagine transferring Ethereum from the Ethereum network to a Cardano user, who would receive&nbsp;either Cardano or Ethereum on the Cardano blockchain; interoperability is in action. It’s not just about currencies but also about data and information.\nNumerous blockchains are built for different reasons&nbsp;to suit various individuals and requirements;&nbsp;&nbsp;as more users get&nbsp;on board,&nbsp;blockchains move closer to their maximum throughput and get congested.\nMulti-technology interoperability between web3.0 and web2.0 technologies must be established for blockchain technology to be deployed at scale.\nInteroperability is just as important now as it was in the early days of the internet before webpages used HTTP to connect between web browsers and servers, SMTP to send emails, and POSIX, the standard that enhances application portability.\nA connected ecosystem would unlock value across technologies and enable individuals and communities to trust and use blockchains extensively with less complexity.\nThere’s so much value to be unlocked if blockchains become interoperable such as:\n\nIncreased network value.\nIncreased agnosticism and decentralization.\nBetter user experience and flexibility.\n\nNumerous blockchain projects embrace interoperability, such as the Octopus network, Cosmos, Polkadot, Aion, and many others; also, there’s the Blockchain Interoperability Alliance, an organization set up to foster blockchain interoperability.\nOpen-source: The Structural Chaos\n\n\nIf you're treating the built-on-open-source-contributors global blockchain as something you pay gas fees to, you don't fully understand the network of code AND people you are involved with - fission.\n\nOpen-source software is distributed under a license permitting concerned entities to use, modify, and distribute the program and its source code.\nOpen-source technology such as Programming languages(PHP, Go, Javascript), libraries (ReactJS, Tensorflow, GPT3), operating systems (Android, Linux, BSD), and a slew of other technologies and projects power most of the world’s technology infrastructure.\nIf Blockchain and Web3.0 are going to be adopted, full transparency is essential right from the project's development to launch to the project's demise. This contributes to many factors, including decent decentralization, robust growth, and contributor economies.\nDecentralization without open source is a one plus one that equals 0.1,  easily insignificant. Opensource patents and laws can protect intellectual property as the contributors desire.\nA completely open-sourced innovative project is more likely to be sustainable and receive contributions and community support over time which also steers it in the community-defined direction.\nOpen source projects should also be governed in a decentralized fashion employing structures like DAOs to ensure the project is steered in the direction of the community’s desires.\nEconomics &amp; Incentives: The Financial Chaos\n\n\nI wrote it once before; I’ll repeat it here.&nbsp;In crypto, you vote with your money. If you keep voting for low energy scams, rich quick schemes, or low effort forks, you will only get more of those - Andre Cronje.\n\nOne of the most delicate composites of the decentralized web is the token economy's creators and owners. This has sprung up questions concerning the spread of participant values, as seen in cases of overpriced digital art, increased scams, and the bizarre APYs promised by protocols that eventually crash and return “This site can’t be reached” afterwards.\nThe world’s economy operates on ponzinomics; we have come to terms with that; however, we could build better this time by relying on mathematics, building sustainably, and designing better token economics systems that are reversible and renewable for more extended periods.\nWhile Web3.0 aims to fully decentralize the internet such that no party gets to control the internet like web2.0 is greatly influenced by the fortune 500 companies, an outlook on the situation see venture capitals as majority stakeholders in many protocols.\nWhy is this important for adoption? since blockchains and web3.0 are deemed low-budget alternatives, they have to offer better UX than existing technologies and economies; the impact matters!\nAlso, the token economy would be more potent if regulated, especially by the government with the values of the crypto economy; but that’s an issue we are not prepared to debate.\nThe After Rant\n\nThe current state of the decentralized web isn't appealing. It seems like a temporary hype or the latest scam. However, the same was acclaimed in the early days of the internet; in essence,  maybe web3.0 needs time.\nAs Web3.0 gets all the time it needs to thrive or get canceled, we must criticize intending to build to perfection or at least a decentralized web with a better user experience.\nNonetheless, Web3 technologies need to be open-source, interoperable, and economically sustainable to thrive.\n\n**Sometimes called a “silent” or a “quiet” revolution, decentralization is among the most significant reforms of the past 50 years. - OECD 2019**\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1029/posts/decentralized-internet/","title":"Here's How to Build a Decentralized Internet"},"http://127.0.0.1:1029/posts/golang-debugging/":{"body":"\nSemaphore made this piece possible. They help product teams deliver software\nwith high standards of quality, security, and efficiency.\nDebugging is a critical aspect of software development; it plays a vital role in ensuring the reliability and stability of applications. Debugging lets you find and fix your application's errors, bugs, and unexpected behaviors\nRegardless of your level of expertise, embracing debugging as an integral part of your development workflow is good practice since debugging also enhances your projects' overall code quality, performance, and maintainability.\nGo provides a robust set of built-in debugging tools that you can use to debug your apps. The tools provide functionality for inspecting variables, tracking program execution, setting breakpoints, and gaining valuable insights into your code’s behavior.\nIdentifying Bugs in Your Go Apps\nBugs are inevitable in software developments, and Go applications are no exception. Identifying and fixing bugs is crucial for maintaining the stability and reliability of your Go apps.\nYou’ll need to be conversant with the common types of bugs in Go applications to tackle them squarely.\nHere are some of the common bugs you’ll find in Go applications:\n\nNull pointer dereference occurs when a variable or pointer is accessed without proper initialization or assignment, leading to crashes and unexpected behavior.\nOut-of-bounds errors that occur when accessing arrays, slices, or strings with invalid indices result in panics or data corruption.\nGoroutine synchronization issues are concurrency bugs that arise when goroutines aren’t properly synchronized, leading to race conditions, deadlocks, or incorrect data sharing.\nResource leaks are caused by a failure to release resources like a database connection or file handles. These problems can cause memory or file descriptor leaks, impacting app performance and scalability.\nType conversion errors happen due\nincorrect type conversios and can introduce subtle bugs, such as data loss or unexpected behavior due to incompatible types.\n\nConsequentially, here are some strategies for identifying and reproducing bugs in your programs\n\nStart by understanding the steps to reproduce the bug consistently. Identify the specific inputs, dependencies, or conditions that trigger the bug. Reproducing the bug is crucial for effective debugging.\nIsolate the bug if the bug is not immediately apparent. You can use techniques like binary search to narrow down the code section where the bug occurs. Temporarily remove unrelated code or simplify the program until the bug is isolated.\nLeverage Go's built-in debugging tools, such as the debugger (Delve) and profiler. These tools provide valuable insights into the state of your application, stack traces, variable values, and performance characteristics.\nStrategic logging and tracing can help pinpoint the location and cause of bugs. Insert log statements at critical points in your code and output relevant information, such as variable values and function execution paths. Use structured logging to make analysis easier.\nWrite comprehensive unit tests that cover different scenarios and edge cases. When you discover the bug, create a unit test that reproduces the issue to ensure that you fix the bug, and there’s no reoccurrence.\nUse techniques such as Test-Driven Development (TDD) or Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) to design your code.\n\nTips for Utilizing Logging and Error Handling for Identifying Bugs\nLogging is a process of recording information about the execution of a program, including the values of the variables, the sequence of execution, and the time of the events.\nError handling is the process of responding to errors during program execution.\nLogging and error handling are effective for identifying and fixing bugs.  By logging information about a program’s execution, you can track down the source of the error and respond to the error to prevent further problems with error handling.\nHere are some tips for utilizing logging and error-handling practices for identifying bugs:\n\nUse error return values, check, and handle errors diligently to prevent bugs from propagating through the application. Avoid swallowing or ignoring errors in your programs.\nWrap errors with additional context using libraries like Go’s built-in errors.Wrap function to add valuable context on where the error originated to aid your bug identification process.\nUse structured logging libraries like zap or logrus to log meaningful information in a structured format like JSON, where you can include relevant data, timestamps, and log levels. Structured logs facilitate easier analysis and debugging.\nWhen handling errors, log stack traces to identify the exact code path leading to the error. Stack trace information is invaluable for debugging. You can use Go’s built-in runtime/debug package for logging stack traces.\nEmploy error monitoring and aggregation tools like Sentry, LogRocket, OpenReplay, or Rollbar to collect and analyze error reports from your production environment. These tools provide insights into recurring errors and help prioritize bug fixes.\nConfigure your CI platform to show error details. On Semaphore, you can do this by setting up test report dashboards.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to identify the bugs in your Go project.\nBest Practices for Debugging Your Go Apps\nThe sequence of actions you take while developing your app is crucial for maintaining high-quality applications.\nHere are some best practices you’ll want to have in mind and follow during your app’s development process to get rid of unnecessary bugs\nWrite Testable Code\nWriting testable code forms the foundation for effective debugging. By designing your app with testability in mind, it’s easier to identify and isolate issues.\nEmbrace unit testing and strive for comprehensive code coverage. Well-designed tests act as a safety net, enabling you to catch errors early on and debug efficiently.\nYou can use tools like Go’s built-in testing package or third-party packages like Testify to automate the testing process and ensure codebase stability.\nUse Panic and Recovery Mechanisms\nGo’s panic and recovery mechanisms are potent error handling and debugging tools. You can use panics to abruptly cease program execution and recovery to regain control and handle a panic gracefully.\nBy strategically incorporating panic and recovery in your code, you can capture critical error scenarios, log relevant information and handle failures gracefully.\nUse panic when anticipating unrecoverable errors and recovery from panics to prevent program termination.\nHere’s a program that illustrates the usage of panic and recovery:\n\nThe recoverFromPanic function uses the recover function to catch and handle panics by checking if there’s a panic before printing a message indicating recovery from a panic.\nThe performDivision function demonstrates the usage of a panic. If the second argument b is zero, it triggers a panic by calling the panic function. Otherwise, the performDivision function performs the division operation and. prints the result.\nYou call the performDivision function thrice with different arguments in the main function. The second call triggers a panic due to an error that’s eventually recovered from with the recoverFromPanic function.\nThe program demonstrates how you can use panic and recovery to handle exceptional situations gracefully in Go programs.\nDebugging in a Development Environment\nDebugging in a controlled environment is essential before deploying your app to production.  You can use tools like Delve to step through your code, set breakpoints, and inspect variables by iteratively debugging in a development environment to catch and resolve issues early and reduce the likelihood of encountering bugs in production.\nGolang Debugging Tools\n\nGo ships with several built-in tools that facilitate efficient debugging, and there are third-party packages for debugging in Go’s ecosystem that provide insight into code execution, help identify issues and optimize performance.\nOne popular Go debugger is Delve. Delve is a powerful tool that you can use to step through code, set breakpoints, and inspect variables at runtime.\nDelve is cross-platform since it provides both CLI and IDE functionality for debugging.\nRun this command in the terminal of your project’s working directory to install Delve.\n\nOnce you’ve installed Delve, you can proceed to debug your apps. One helpful measure for debugging apps is stepping through code to inspect variables.\nStepping Through Code and Inspect Variables With Delve\n\"Stepping through code\" is executing a program line by line to observe its behavior instead of running the entire program at once.  As you step through the code, you can examine how the state of your program changes, set breakpoints at specific lines, and pause the program.\nOn the other hand, inspecting variables involves examining the current values stored in different variables during program execution. You get to view the values of local and global variables to understand how they’re changing and potentially causing issues to track the flow of data and determine where errors are occurring.\nHere’s an example Go program for debugging:\n\nTo debug the program with Delve, you’ll need to install the Delve CLI tool on your machine. Once installed, you can run the program with the dlv debug command followed by the program's path:\n\nThe command will start the Delve debugger and load the program for debugging. Delve will display a (dlv) prompt, indicating that you can now execute debugger commands.\nHere’s a table of the debugger commands and their functionality:\nCommandDescription (Functionality)\nb  or breakpoint Sets a breakpoint at the specified location. For example, you can set a breakpoint at line 6 with breakpoint main.add.\nc or continueContinues the execution of the program until the next breakpoint or the program exits.\nn or nextExecutes the next line of code.\ns or stepSteps into functions.\np  or print Prints the value of the specified variable.\nq or quitExits the debugger.\n\nUse the appropriate commands to navigate your code, set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through the program's execution to identify and debug any issues.\nYou can use the help command in Delve for a complete list of available commands and their descriptions. In this case, set a breakpoint at line 14, right before the println statement:\n\nContinue the program’s execution:\n\nThe program will run until it hits the breakpoint. Delve will stop at the specified line, and you can now inspect the variables and their values to identify the bug.\nYou can print the value of the variable with the print command followed by the variable name as thus:\n\nDelve will display the value of x in the debug console.\nYou can step through the code with the following command with n to execute the next line of code and trace the program execution.\n\nAs you step through the code, you’ll reach the line with the bug and see that sum has an unexpected value due to the subtraction bug. You can analyze the variables and code logic to identify and fix the issue.\nProfiling Your Go Code With Pprof\nAnother efficient measure of debugging your Go code is profiling. Profiling allows you to gather runtime information about the performance of your program to help you identify bottlenecks and areas of improvement.\nGo provides a built-in profiling tool called pprof for collecting and analyzing profiling data.\nHere's how you can start a profiler on a file creation operation:\n\nThe program imports the os and pprof packages. The main function creates a file with the os.Create function and a defer statement calls closes the file stream with the Close function; then the function calls the pprof.StartCPUProfile function that takes the file f as an argument and starts profiling the CPU usage of the program. Another defer statement is used to ensure that pprof.StopCPUProfile is called at the end of the main function, and the data collected is flushed to the file.\nYou can use the go tool pprof command-line tool to analyze the profiling data. You can run this command to analyze a CPU profile snapshot:\n\nYou’ll replace &lt;profile-file&gt; with the path to the profile snapshot file generated by the program.\nHere's the result of running the command for the program above:\n\nThe go tool pprof provides various commands and options to explore the collected profiling data. You can use the top command to see the functions consuming the most CPU time or the web command to generate an interactive graphical visualization of the profile.\nBy analyzing the profiling data, you can identify performance bottlenecks in your code. The information from profiling can guide you in optimizations and improving your Go program's overall efficiency.\nThe Debugging Process With Goland\nGoLand, the integrated development environment (IDE) developed by Jetbrains for Go, offers robust debugging tools for enhancing the debugging process and streamlining development workflows.\nWith GoLand, you get intelligent code completion, code inspection, and error highlighting, ensuring you write clean and error-free code. The IDE also includes powerful refactoring tools that enable you to restructure your code without introducing bugs.\nGoLand provides a feature-rich debugger that lets you step through your code, inspect variables, set breakpoints, and more.\nYou can easily set breakpoints in the GoLand IDE by clicking on the left-hand gutter next to the line where you want to set a breakpoint. The red dot specifies that you’ve set a break-point.\nYou can set breakpoints on any line of code with GoLand:\n\nAfter setting a breakpoint, you can start the debugger by clicking the green Debug button in the toolbar or the keyboard shortcut for debugging on your operating system. Running the debugger will pause the code execution at the first breakpoint it encounters.\n\nOnce the program pauses at a breakpoint, you can step through the code to understand its flow and identify issues. GoLand provides multiple options for stepping through code.\nHere’s an overview of the commands and their description:\n\nCommandDescription\nStep Over (F8)Executes the current line and moves to the next line. If the current line contains a function call, it will be executed without stepping into the function.\nStep Into (F7)Executes the current line and steps into any function call on that line, allowing you to explore the internal workings of functions.\nStep Out (Shift+F8)Executes the remaining lines of the current function and returns to the calling function.\nRun to Cursor (Alt+F9)Runs the program until it reaches the line where the cursor is currently positioned without setting a permanent breakpoint.\n\nInspecting variables and expressions to understand their dynamics is crucial during your debugging process. GoLand’s debugger provides a Variables view that displays variables' current state, allowing you to examine their values. You can also add expressions to the Watches view to track specific variables.\n\nYou can also access built-in tools for error analysis and code navigation.\nHere are some of the features and techniques you can use to leverage these tools effectively:\nFeatureCommand(s)Description\nSyntax and Error HighlightingN/AGoLand automatically highlights syntax errors, semantic errors, and potential issues in your code. It uses red squiggly lines for syntax errors and different colors for other issues. You can hover over the highlighted code to see error messages and suggestions.\nCode InspectionsAnalyze menu or shortcut key combination (e.g., Ctrl+Alt+Shift+I)GoLand provides code inspections to help detect and fix issues. It checks for code redundancies, performance optimizations, style violations, and more. Inspections can be run on specific files, packages, or the entire project using the \"Analyze\" menu or shortcut keys.\nError/Warning ExplorationF2 (or Cmd+Down on macOS)When encountering an error or warning, you can navigate directly to the problematic code by clicking on the highlighted line or using the shortcut F2 (Cmd+Down on macOS). This action takes you to the relevant file and line, facilitating error inspection and resolution.\nGo to Definition/DeclarationCtrl+Click (or Cmd+Click on macOS), Ctrl+B (or Cmd+B on macOS)The \"Go to Definition\" feature allows navigation to the definition or declaration of a function, variable, or type. Place the cursor on the symbol, press Ctrl+Click (Cmd+Click on macOS), or use the shortcut Ctrl+B (Cmd+B on macOS).\nFind UsagesRight-click on symbol, select \"Find Usages\"You can find a specific symbol's usages in your codebase using the \"Find Usages\" feature. Right-click on a symbol and select \"Find Usages\" from the context menu. It will display a list of locations where the symbol is used, allowing you to navigate through them.\nCode Structure NavigationCtrl+F12 (or Cmd+F12 on macOS)GoLand provides a hierarchical view of your code's structure, which you can access through the \"Structure\" tool window or by pressing Ctrl+F12 (Cmd+F12 on macOS). This view helps you navigate through different functions, methods, and types in your code quickly.\nRefactoring ToolsRight-click on symbol or block of code, select refactoring option from context menuGoLand includes a set of refactoring tools to assist you in code restructuring and maintenance. You can rename variables, extract functions, inline variables, and perform many other code transformations. Right-click on a symbol or a block of code and select the appropriate refactoring option from the context menu.\nQuick Documentation LookupCtrl+Q (or F1 on macOS)To quickly view the documentation for a function, type, or package, you can use the \"Quick Documentation Lookup\" feature. Place the cursor on the symbol and press Ctrl+Q (F1 on macOS). It will display the relevant documentation, function signatures, and additional information.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the error analysis and code navigation tools available in GoLand. The IDE offers many more features and shortcuts to enhance your coding experience. You can explore the documentation and experiment with the different functionalities to find the ones that best suit your workflow.\nGoLand is a paid product; however, it is free for students and academic purposes. You can start a free 30-day trial and get a license.\nYou can also resort to use the Delve extension for VSCode for a wholesome, free development experience.\nConclusion\nYou’ve learned about debugging in Go, how to identify bugs, debugging tools, best practices for debugging, and how you can debug your Go programs with Delve and GoLand.\nDebugging is an essential part of the software development cycle, so ensure you debug your apps before pushing them to production.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1029/posts/golang-debugging/","title":"Debugging Your Go Apps"},"http://127.0.0.1:1029/posts/pavex/":{"body":"\nLogRocket made this piece possible. They provide AI-first session replay and analytics that shows\nyou what's wrong.\n\nThere are many web frameworks available for developers to choose from — including more than ten popular web frameworks\nin the Rust ecosystem. Each Rust framework is opinionated, following the principles and practices of several developers\nto optimize and ensure they follow great web development methods.\nIn 2022, Luca Palmieri set out to build the Pavex Rust framework with the aim of achieving great ergonomics, high\nperformance, great usability, and speed on top of the popular Hyper framework. Today, Pavex is in beta and ready to use\nwith these features all coming into play, plus more features like better error messages.\nWhat is Pavex?\nPavex is a new and upcoming Rust framework designed to expand the horizon for Rust web development. It aims to do so by\noffering a more abstract, ergonomic, and performant development experience.\nThe Pavex web framework for Rust ensures compile-time safety and better error messaging reducing the learning curve\nassociated with handling compile-time errors and framework overhead. Its architecture is focused on minimizing\nuser-facing content to provide a clean API and developer-friendly approach.\nGetting started with Pavex\nSince Pavex is Rust-based, you’ll need the Rust toolchain (Rustup and Cargo specifically). Head on to the Rust\ninstallation page to install if you don’t have Rust.\nYou’ll also need to have cargo-px and a cargo  subcommand. You can install cargo-px with the directives from its\ndocumentation page.\nYou’d need to have all these tools available in your PATH, so ensure you do that while installing. You can run this\ncommand to verify your installation.\n\nNext, you need to install Rust’s nightly toolchain. You can add it to your toolchain with this command:\n\nAfter installing nightly, add the rust-docs-json component to the build:\n\nFinally, you need to install and activate the Pavex CLI tool. Execute this command to install Pavex:\n\nYou can execute this command to verify the installation:\n\nPavex is in beta, so you need to activate Pavex with an activation key:\n\nYou can retrieve an activation from the Pavex Discord server’s #activation channel after you’ve joined the beta on\nPavex.dev.\nEnter the activation key, and then you can proceed to create a new Pavex project with this command:\n\nOpen the new Pavex project in your code environment of choice. You should see a folder structure similar to this:\n\nYou can proceed to execute a demo Pavex project with this command:\n\nOn executing the command, you should get this as output as the server runs on the default port 8080:\n\nYou can send a cURL request to the ping the server like so:\n\nHere’s the output you should expect:\n\nYou need to understand how a Pavex project works to build with the framework. At the core of every Pavex project is\nthe Blueprint type. You’ll use the Blueprint type to define routes, middleware, error handlers and other functions.\nCheck the pavex_tutorial/src/blueprint.rs file for the Blueprint of your pavex_tutorial project. Here’s what you\nshould expect to see:\n\nThe blueprint function contains all the routes, constructors and error handlers. Pavex requires the blueprint\nfunction to run.\nCreating your first Pavex route\nRouting with Pavex is simple and intuitive compared to many other Rust web frameworks.\nYou’ll register routes, middleware, etc, in the register function after writing the handler functions like this:\n\nAbove, we registered the GET request handler function named hello with the /api/hello/:name route. Then, here’s how\nyou can extract and use path parameters with Pavex:\n\nYou can use a struct to model the objects you’re expecting from a request. The HelloParameters struct is the struct\nfor the name parameter from the request. The hello function retrieves the path parameter and writes a string with\nthe path parameter to the client as a response.\nHandling request data with Pavex\nHandling request data of all sorts with Pavex is also very intuitive. You can use the serde and serde_json crates\nwith Pavex for JSON operations. Pavex also provides a JsonBody function for parsing the body of an incoming request as\nJSON.\nHere’s the full list of imports you’ll need to handle request JSON request data:\n\nNext, here’s a User struct for the JSON operation. The #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)] macro adds serialization\nand deserialization functionality via the serde crate:\n\nThen, here’s how you can deserialize a JSON payload into the User struct:\n\nThe create_user function is a request handler that handles POST requests for creating a new user. It accepts\nJSON-encoded data from the request body and deserializes it to retrieve the data in a struct-like manner.\nPavex’s JsonBody&lt;T&gt; extractor deserializes the JSON from the request body.\nHere’s how you can register the create_user handler function in the register function.\n\nThe create_user function’s functionality is now accessible via the /api/users route, and you can make requests to\nit.\nResponding to requests\nYou can respond to client requests using Pavex’s Response object. Here’s how you can implement a GET request handler\nfunction:\n\nThe get_user function creates a User struct instance, serializes the struct to a JSON string and handles associated\nerrors. Then, it sets the response content type to application/json and writes the serialized struct as a response to\nthe client.\nUsing middlewares with Pavex\nPavex middleware simplify adding pre- and post-processing steps to your handler functions.\nHere’s an example of how you can use middleware in your Pavex projects:\n\nThe logging_middleware function uses the Next objects to help with proceeding with the request flow. The function\nlogs a message before and after execution of the next handler function in the chain.\nHere’s an example of how you can register the middleware in the register function:\n\nThe wrap function register a wrapping middleware. The logging_middleware function now wraps the handler functions\nyou’ve specified.\nComparing Pavex to existing Rust frameworks\nAlthough it’s new, we’ve seen that Pavex provides most of the features you’ll need in a Rust web framework, including\nasync/await support, middleware, concurrency, and much more.\nPavex is an exciting framework with better documentation, error handling, and semantics than other popular existing web\nframeworks for Rust. It’s designed for building small- to enterprise-grade applications without trade-offs.\nHere’s how Pavex currently compares to the Actix Web, Rocket, Axum, and warp Rust web frameworks:\nFeaturesPavexActixRocketAxumwarp\nAsync/await supportYesYesYesYesYes\nMiddlewareExtensive support with built-in middleware and support for custom middlewareExtensive, with support for custom middlewareBuilt-in support for various middleware functionalitiesUtilizes the tower ecosystem for middlewareUses filters for middleware-like functionality\nWebSockets supportNoComprehensive supportSupported with specific syntax and featuresSupported, and integrated with async programming modelSupported, designed for asynchronous communication\nConcurrency &amp; PerformanceBuilt on Tokio, optimized for async executionHigh performance, designed for concurrencyPerformance-focused, with specific features for concurrencyBuilt on Tokio, optimized for async executionLeverages async execution for performance\nCookie and session managementNot yetFull-featured supportComprehensive handling capabilitiesThrough extractors and middlewareVia filters and custom implementations\nCommunity and ecosystemFew beta testers at the momentLarge, with extensive resourcesWell-established, with comprehensive documentationGrowing benefits from Tokio ecosystemActive part of the Tokio ecosystem\n\nChoosing a Rust web framework should be based on your project’s specifications and needs. You can use this comparison\ntable as a guide to choose a framework after evaluating the project’s specifications.\nConclusion\nPavex is still very new (in closed beta), and before the project is open to the public, you can expect that more\nfeatures will roll out. However, keep in mind that it’s not meant to be an open source framework — Palmieri intends to\nadd a usage price to the project, although the pricing plan is not yet finalized.\nIn this article, we learned about the Pavex framework and how you can use it for Rust web development. Pavex is an\nexciting project for many Rust devs especially in terms of the fact that it improves on the functionality of many\nexisting frameworks. It has great development experience — you should try it out when it’s live.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1029/posts/pavex/","title":"Web Development in Rust with Pavex"},"http://127.0.0.1:1029/posts/rust-gats/":{"body":"\nLogRocket made this piece possible. They provide AI-first session replay and analytics that shows\nyou what's wrong.\nGeneric associated types in Rust can help us address some of the language’s limitations and improve performance.\n\nBefore GATs, Rust had associated types that enabled type association with traits. However, these were not directly tied\nto the generic parameters of the implementing type. GATs enhance this concept by allowing associated types to depend on\nthe generic parameters of a trait.\nGATs are useful in several scenarios, including the expression of iterator patterns and futures\nand asynchronous programming. Here, async libraries\ncan leverage GATs to define traits with associated types that accurately represent these dependencies and provide more\nprecise type information for async operations.\nIn this article, we will explore some ways we can use GATs in Rust to improve our code and application performance.\nNote that GATs became a stable Rust feature in v1.65. Since GATs were unstable before v1.65, you must\nadd #![feature(generic_associated_types)] to use GATs in earlier Rust versions.\nGetting started with Rust generic associated types\nRust traits can have associated types. However, before GATS, these associated types could not have their own generic\nparameters. GATs lift this\nrestriction, allowing associated types to be generic\nand have a lifetime or type parameter.\nConsider this example Rust trait with an associated type:\n\nThe Producer trait has a produce() method that takes a reference to self and returns an item of type Self::Item.\nThe Self::Item syntax refers to the associated Item type defined within the trait.\nWith GATs, you can extend the trait to allow the associated type to have a generic parameter:\n\nIn this case, the Producer trait declares the produce method that takes a value of type T as a parameter and returns\nan\nitem of type Self::Item&lt;T&gt;. The syntax Self::Item&lt;T&gt; refers to the associated type Item&lt;T&gt; associated with the\nimplementing type.\nGATs form a cornerstone in Rust’s type system, offering a previously unattainable level of expressiveness. They allow\nyou to write more generic and reusable code, reducing boilerplate and enhancing code maintainability.\nFor instance, GATs enable you to define traits that return types with lifetimes tied to self, which previously wasn’t\npossible. This capability is crucial for creating iterator traits that yield references to their items, amongst other\napplications.\nWhen to use GATs in Rust\nGATs are handy in scenarios where you need to express complex relationships between types and lifetimes in Rust. They\nare especially useful when designing APIs that need to return types with lifetimes tied to self or when creating generic\ndata structures.\nConsider a scenario where you’re creating a data structure that holds a collection of items and provides an iterator\nover the items. Without GATs, you’ll have to use Box&lt;dyn Iterator&gt;, which incurs a runtime cost.\nWith GATs, you can express this naturally like so:\n\nHere, the iterable trait has two associated types — Item and Iterator. The Item associated type represents a type\nof the\niterable elements, and the Iterator generic associated type represents the Iterator type that the iter method returns.\nExploring use cases for GATs in Rust programs\nThere are several reasons and use cases for GATs in your everyday Rust programs, including avoiding unnecessary\nallocations, enabling more efficient code generation, and improving code ergonomics. Let’s explore each of these in more\ndetail below.\nAvoiding unnecessary allocations\nOne everyday use for GATs is avoiding unnecessary allocations. You can prevent unnecessary allocations by defining a\ntrait for iterators that allocates memory when necessary.\nHere’s a trait that defines an iterator that can iterate over the elements of a collection and allocates memory for used\nelements:\n\nThe Rust program above implements a custom iterator with GATs. The LendingIterator trait mimics the behavior of an\niterator.\nThe type Item&lt;'a&gt;: 'a where Self: 'a; line defines an associated type for the LendingIterator trait.\nMeanwhile, fn next&lt;'a&gt;(&amp;'a mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;Self::Item&lt;'a&gt;&gt; is a signature for the next method required for types\nthat implement the LendingIterator trait.\nThe MyVec type implements the LendingIterator trait, and the main function creates a MyVec and prints the elements\nbefore removing the elements from the vector.\nHere’s the output from running the program:\n\nEnabling more efficient code generation\nGATs can help with more efficient code generation. You can use GATS to define a trait for generic data structures that\nthen generate code for data structures that your program uses. Let’s explore an example to understand this concept\nbetter.\nHere’s a trait that defines a generic data structure for representing a tree:\n\nThe Tree trait represents the type of elements in the tree. The root() method returns a reference to the tree’s\nroot.\nThe left() and right() methods return references to the left and right subtrees of the tree, respectively.\nThe Tree trait doesn’t generate any code. Instead, it leaves the task to the types that implement the trait to decide\nthe methods to implement depending on the specific tree type being represented.\nBy using generic associated types, the Tree trait allows for flexibility in defining the types of items and left and\nright subtrees within a tree data structure. The implementing types of the Tree trait will determine the specific types\nfor Item, Left, and Right.\nThis approach can help you generate more efficient code for various tree data structures.\nImproving the ergonomics of your code\nYou can use GATs to improve your code ergonomics in multiple ways. You can define a trait for generic builders that\neases the creation of complex data structures.\nHere’s a trait that defines a generic builder for creating trees:\n\nYou can use the TreeBuilder trait to create complex trees easily. The trait provides methods for creating trees with one\nroot value, along with a left and right subtree. The build method returns a reference to the tree.\nConclusion\nIn this article, we discussed generic associated types (GATs) in Rust. We explored some of their use cases and how you\ncan use them to improve the overall performance of your Rust applications.\nGATs provide a more expressive and powerful way to model relationships between generic and associated types in Rust.\nThey enable more precise type information and help you implement advanced patterns and libraries in areas such as\niterator design, asynchronous programming, and type-level computations.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1029/posts/rust-gats/","title":"Using Rust GATs to improve code and application performance"},"http://127.0.0.1:1029/posts/testify/":{"body":"\nSemaphore made this piece possible. They help product teams deliver software\nwith high standards of quality, security, and efficiency.\nTesting is essential to the software development cycle, ensuring code integrity, reliability, and quality. As the complexity of software systems increases, testing becomes crucial to identify bugs and errors that may lead to system failure.\nGo provides the testing package for testing however, writing tests with the package can be time-consuming and tedious. Fortunately, the Go ecosystem is home to sophisticated third-party packages like Testify that make test-related tasks more intuitive.\nTestify is a popular testing toolkit for Go that provides a set of utilities and assertion functions that simplify testing. Testify extends the built-in testing package, allowing Go developers to write comprehensive tests confidently with features from assertions, mocks, suites, and others.\nGetting Started With the Testify Package\n\nGetting started with the testify package is easy. You’ll need to install the package in your Go project and write the tests in your Go test files.\nFirst, initialize a new Go project with the go mod init command.\n\nNext, Run this command in the terminal of your project’s directory to install the testify package using the go get command.\n\nYou can set up the Testify package in your Go project by importing the package into your test files.\n\nYou’ll need a Go test file to run your tests with the testify package. Typical Go test files end with the _test.go suffix appended to the file name where the functions you’re testing are located.\nRun this command in your project’s working directory to create a Go test file for this tutorial.\n\nYou can run all the tests in your Go project with the test command. Adding the -v flag returns a verbose output of the test.\n\nThe testify package provides packages for multiple functionalities. You’ll use packages like assert and mock for assertions and mock testing along with other packages in the testify package.\nAssertions with Testify\nAssertions are statements that validate certain conditions to test the behavior of a function or a piece of code. In Testify, the assert package provides various assertion functions for various test cases.\nHere’s a function that adds two numbers and returns the sum and an error type. \n\nThe MyFunction function takes in two integers. If any of the integers is a negative number on the function call , the function returns 0 and an error with the fmt package’s Errorf function.\nHere’s how you can test the MyFunction function with the testify package’s Equal, NoError, and Error functions. \n\nThe functions are typical Go test functions that take, in instances of the *testing.T type for the tests. \nThe TestMyFunction test function calls the   MyFunction and uses the Equal function of the assert package to assert equality between the result and 5. The NoError function of the assert package asserts that a function returned no errors.\nSimilarly, the TestMyFunction2 test function calls the  MyFunction and uses the Equal function of the assert package to assert equality between the result and 0. The Error function of the assert package asserts that a function returned errors.\nBoth test functions should pass since the MyFunction function returns the same result as the edge case in both scenarios.\n\nMocks with Testify\nMocks are objects that simulate the behavior of real objects. Mocks are useful for testing interactions between different parts of a system. The mock package provides functionality for mock testing in the testify package. \nHere’s how you can create a simple mock object for testing.\n\nAfter importing the mock and assert packages you declared the mockCalculateArea struct that embeds the Mock type from the mock package for the calculateArea function.\nThe calculateArea function implements the mockCalculateArea struct. The args variable holds the arguments passed to the mock object (the width and height arguments). Then the Int function takes in zero and extracts the first integer value from the  mock.Arguments object and returns the value as the result of the mock function.\nHere’s how you can create mock objects for your test functions.\n\nThe TestCalculateArea function uses  the mockCalculateArea mock object to test the calculateArea function. The new function creates a new mock object of the mockCalculateArea type to simulate the behavior of the calculateArea function during the test.\nThe  TestCalculateArea function sets the expected return value of the calculateArea function using the On method of the mock object that takes in the expected input values for the function call as arguments (5 and 10 in this case) and the expected return value (50 in this case).\nThe calculateArea method calls the mock object with the same input values (5 and 10) as the expected function call. The actual return value of the function is stored in the actualArea variable.\nThe assert.Equal function verifies that the actualArea variable equals the expected return value (50 in this case). If the actual value doesn’t match the expected value, the test fails, and the message is printed to the console.\nFinally, the function calls the AssertExpectations method of the mock object to verify that the test made the expected function call during the test. If the function wasn’t called with the expected input values, the test fails.\n\nTest Suites with Testify\nTest suites are collections of test cases designed to test the functionality of a specific software application, system, or component. Test suites typically include a set of test cases executed concurrently in a predefined order to achieve a specific testing goal.\nYou’ll need to define a struct that embeds the Suite type of the suite package to define test suits. The functions for the test suite will implement the struct type that embeds the Suite type.\n\nThe MySuite is the struct that embeds the Suite function for the test suite and the methods that implement the MySuite function define various test functions. \nYou can run all the test suites with the Run function of the suite package. \n\nThe run function takes in the testing instance and an instance of the test suite struct and runs the methods that implement the struct.\n\nTest Hooks With Testify\nTest hooks are special functions that execute before or after running tests. You can use test hooks to set up test fixtures, perform clean-up tasks or customize test behavior.\nHere’s how you can implement test hooks in your Go programs.\n\nThe TestExample function is the test function containing three nested test functions before, after and tests created with the Run method of the test instance that creates subtests that you can run independently from other tests. \nThe before and after functions are test hooks that get executed before and after the test function, respectively. You can perform any operations inside these functions. In the test function, the Testify assert package makes assertions on the expected behavior of the code. In the previous example, we used the assert.Equal method to check that 1+1 equals 2.\nTDD vs. BDD with Testify\nRecently, two popular testing methodologies have garnered popularity, namely Test Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior Driven Development (BDD). TDD and BDD are both used to ensure that software meets certain requirements and functions as intended.\nTDD is a development approach where you write tests before writing the actual code. The idea behind TDD is to write small, testable units of code that meet the requirements of the software. After writing the tests, you write code that passes the tests. \nTDD is all about writing tests that drive the development of the code. This approach ensures that the code meets the requirements and is of high quality.\nBDD, on the other hand, is a development approach focused on the behavior of the software. With BDD, you write tests that describe the expected behavior of the software. The tests are usually written in a specific syntax called Gherkin, designed to be effortlessly intuitive for both technical and non-technical stakeholders. BDD is all about describing the behavior of the software in a way that is understandable to everyone involved.\nHow Testify Supports TDD and BDD\nTestify supports both TDD and BDD testing methodologies. The suite of testing tools that the Testify package provides makes it easy to write tests that meet the requirements of the software.\nFor TDD, Testify provides tools for writing unit tests. These tools include assertions, mocks, and test suites. With Testify, developers can write tests that ensure that their code meets the requirements and behaves as expected.\nFor BDD, Testify provides a Gherkin-style syntax for writing tests, designed for easy readability by both technical and non-technical stakeholders. Testify's BDD tools also include assertions, mocks, and test suites. With Testify, you can write tests that describe the expected behavior of your software in a way that’s understandable for everyone involved.\nTopicTDD with TestifyBDD with Testify\nGolang Testify PackageProvides various testing functions and assertions for writing tests in GoSupports both TDD and BDD methodologies by providing assertion functions and the suite.Suite interface for  defining test suites\nPurposeEmphasizes on testing the functionalityFocuses on testing the behavior\nTest StructureYou write test cases for each functionYou write test cases for each behavior/scenario\nSyntaxUses assertions for checking the expected resultsUses natural language statements (Given-When-Then format) for describing test cases\nUser InvolvementPrimarily for developersInvolves developers, testers, and business stakeholders\nCollaborationMinimal CollaborationEngages collaboration between developers, testers, and business stakeholders\nTest DocumentationRequires use of documentation to explain the code logicYou  create Documentation using natural language to describe code behaviour\n\nThe table serves as a comparison between both methodologies and isn’t exhaustive. Testify provides functionality for both TDD and BDD and you can use the package for any of the approaches.\nBenefits of Using Testify\nMost Go developers choose to Testify for testing their applications due to the many benefits, features, and functionalities that the package provides. \nHere’s an overview of the benefits you access when using the Testify package.\n\nIt allows you to define subtests for testing different scenarios within a single test function. Subtests make it easy to group related test cases together and improve test organization.\nThe library provides functionality for colorful and readable output formatting that can make it easier to identify and fix test failures. Outputs like helpful error messages, stack traces, and logs are all presented in an easy-to-read format.\nTestify provides a wide range of assertion functions that you can use to write concise and clear test cases. The assertion functions writing tests that are both simple and expressive easy, reducing the amount of boilerplate code.\nIt includes a mock package for creating mock objects and functions for testing. The mock package is especially useful when testing code that has external dependencies, as it allows you to isolate the code from its dependencies. The mock package is easy to use, and the package can help you save a significant amount of time when writing tests.\n\nTestify vs GoConvey\nTo fully understand the benefits of using the Testify package, you can compare the package to other popular testing packages like the GoConvey package. \nThe GoConvey package is a testing framework that provides high-level API for defining test suites and test cases, including  a web-based user interface for viewing and analyzing test results\nHere’s a comparison table comparing the Testify and GoConvey packages.\nFeature/BenefitTestifyGoConvey\nAssertion FunctionsTestify provides a wide range of assertion functions that you can use to write concise and clear test cases. These include functions like assert.Equal, assert.NotEqual, assert.True, assert.False, and many more.GoConvey also provides a range of assertion functions like So, ShouldBeEqual, ShouldNotBeEmpty, and others, but the list of assertion functions isn’t as extensive as Testify.\nMockingTestify provides a mock package that you can use to create mock objects and functions for testing.GoConvey does not provide built-in mocking capabilities.\nSuite Setup and TeardownTestify allows for set up and tear down test suite fixtures, which can save you time and reduce code duplication.GoConvey does not have built-in support for test suite setup and teardown.\nOutput FormattingTestify provides colorful and readable output formatting that’s useful for identifying and fixing test failures.GoConvey's output is less visually appealing and can be harder to read.\n\nTestify provides many benefits beyond the standard Go testing package, including a wide range of assertion functions, built-in mocking, test suite setup and teardown, subtests, and better output formatting. While GoConvey also provides some of these features, Testify has a more extensive list of assertion functions and built-in mocking capabilities, making the package a more powerful testing tool.\nConclusion\nYou’ve learned the importance of testing and the limitations of using the standard Go testing package and explored Testify's assertion functions, mock testing functionalities, and test suites, learned about TDD and BDD and how Testify supports the testing methodologies, compared Testify and GoConvey packages and highlighted the advantages of using Testify. \nOn using Testify in your Go projects, you can write tests that are simple and expressive, thereby ensuring that your code meets the requirements with high quality.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1029/posts/testify/","title":"Step up Your Go App Testing Game With the Testify Framework"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1029/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1029/posts/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1029/posts/decentralized-internet/":{"body":592,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1029/posts/golang-debugging/":{"body":1809,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1029/posts/pavex/":{"body":795,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1029/posts/rust-gats/":{"body":648,"title":7},"http://127.0.0.1:1029/posts/testify/":{"body":1345,"title":8}},"length":7},"lang":"English"};
