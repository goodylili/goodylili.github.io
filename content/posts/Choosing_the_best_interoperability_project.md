_**[Axelar](axelar.network) made this piece possible. Axelar is the shortest path to scale your web3 application across
blockchains**_

Interoperability solutions are evolving to support more blockchains and asset classes while improving on the security
defects that have occurred in the past and birthing more paradigms for adoption.

It’s safe to say that Interop is the technology at the edge of improving crypto UX in tokenizing real-world assets,
decentralized stablecoins, and chain abstraction.

This short article highlights the most prominent players in interoperability. It provides a brief overview of their
features and aspects to help you make informed, data-driven decisions if you’re trying to choose an interop solution.

## 1. Axelar Network

[Axelar](http://axelar.network) is the web3 interoperability layer for seamless communication and asset transfers
between blockchains.

Axelar features a decentralized architecture with a proof of stake mechanism from the Cosmos SDK that allows You to
integrate chains from Cosmos, Ethereum, and several other ecosystems to build cross-chain apps, smart contracts, and
tokens.

Axelar supports the entire blockchain interoperability stack from chain abstraction to interchain tokens and messaging
on fungible, non-fungible and real-world assets.

For Security, Axelar uses the validator network from the Axelar chain to maintain integrity for cross-chain
transactions. The validators validate transactions for consensus before execution to mitigate the risk of single points
of failure and the constant hacks you may be prone to from using other solutions.

## 2. Wormhole

Wormhole is a cross-chain messaging protocol for transferring data and assets across multiple blockchains.

Wormhole provides tools to build cross-chain DeFi protocols and governance systems on 30+ supported Solana, Ethereum,
and Move blockchains.

For Security, Wormhole is secured by 19 globally distributed Guardian nodes that sign messages via private key proof of
authority.

## 3. LayerZero

LayerZero is another cross-chain messaging protocol for bridging assets and message passing between networks.

LayerZero allows you to build apps across chains while controlling their security models.

The LayerZero architecture provides nearly instant finality for cross-chain transactions, so they’re confirmed as soon
as they’re included in a block.

For Security, LayerZero uses multiple approaches, including a decentralized verification network (DVN) that is
permissible enough for anyone to enhance security further and Pre-crime detection for malicious transactions where the
relayer should stop hacks before they happen.

## 4. Hyperlane

Hyperlane is an open, customizable messaging protocol that’s easy to deploy on any blockchain.

Hyperplane focuses on flexibility and autonomy. With Hyperlane, You can choose what chains you want to integrate based
on your security preferences,

Hyperlane uses a slashing mechanism for its validator set (proof-of-stake) to disincentivize malicious behaviour. Each
supported blockchain has its validator set, and you can define your security protocols through sovereign consensus.

## Comparing the Interoperability Projects

These interoperability projects have unique features and are tailored for various project types with varying approaches
to security and flexibility.

Here’s a comparison table that overviews the different aspects of blockchain interoperability across the big players in
interoperability.
